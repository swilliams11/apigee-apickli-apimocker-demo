# Mockbackend

This backend use API Mocker as a Hosted Target in Apigee Edge.  It does not have any policies included on the proxy.  

## Test the app locally
  Before pushing to Apigee, it can be useful to test the application locally first to make sure everything is working as it should.

  1. Make sure you have [Nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) installed
  2. Install dependencies:

      ```
      cd apiproxy/resources/hosted
      npm install
      ```

  3. Start the application:

      ```
      PORT=8081 node index.js
      ```

  4. Test the application:

      ```
      curl http://localhost:8081/
      ```

      Response:
      ```
      {"msg":"Hello!"}
      ```

  5. Remove node_modules and package-lock.json:

      ```
      rm -rf node_modules
      rm package-lock.json
      ```

  6. Go back to the home directory for deploying:

      ```
      cd ../../..
      ```

## Deploy the proxy
  1. Make sure you have [apigeetool](https://github.com/apigee/apigeetool-node) installed
  2. [OPTIONAL] Make sure you have [get_token](https://apidocs.apigee.com/api-reference/content/using-oauth2-security-apigee-edge-management-api) script installed
  3. Deploy your proxy:

      ```
      mvn install -Dapigee.username=$APIGEE_UNAME -Dapigee.org=$APIGEE_ORG -Dapigee.env=$APIGEE_ENV -Dapigee.password=$APIGEE_PW -DskipTests=true
      ```
      **Note**: This step might take a minute or two to work

  4. Test your proxy deployment:

      ```
      curl https://<apigee org>-<apigee env>.apigee.net/mockbackend
      ```
